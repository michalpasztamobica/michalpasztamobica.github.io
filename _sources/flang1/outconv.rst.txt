Output Converter

========
Overview
========
The output converter converts foralls into DO loops, handles allocate
and deallocate statements, and optimizes array descriptor handling.

----------------------
Global Data Structures
----------------------
.uh "Symbol Table"
The symbol table is accessed.
.uh "AST"
Statements are inserted and deleted.

Local Data Structures
---------------------
There are no significant local data structures in the Output Converter.

Processing
==========


--------
Overview
--------
The main entry point to the output converter is
``convert_output()``.
It calls
``convert_forall()``
to convert forall statements and allocate/deallocate statements. It then
calls
``transform_wrapup()``
to output descriptor information.


-----------------
Forall Conversion
-----------------
This task is performed by
``conv_forall()``.
One DO loop is created for each forall index, and the forall statement
is converted to a comment.  No dependence checking is done; currently
it is assumed that earlier phases have removed any dependences that prevent
simple conversion to DO loops.

Mask expressions are converted to IF statements inside the loop.

Forall conversion will likely be changed in a future release to perform more
optimal scalarization, loop fusions, etc.


-------------------
Allocate/Deallocate
-------------------
Allocate and deallocate statements are handled by
``conv_allocate``
and
``conv_deallocate``.
If necessary,
descriptors are created and initialized. It may also be necessary to
initialize the array bounds variables if a deferred-shape array is allocated.


-----------
Descriptors
-----------
``transform_wrapup()``
is contained in the file
``dpm_out.c``.
It loops over each entry point in the subprogram, and performs the following
tasks:

#. Transform arguments to support the Fotran calling convention.

#. Initialize processor and template descriptors.

#. Perform copy_in and copy_out on array arguments.

#. Initialize common blocks.

#. Create alignment and distribution descriptors.

#. Allocate distributed array sections.

The program return statement is preceeded by statements to free the
descriptors, local arrays, and so forth.
