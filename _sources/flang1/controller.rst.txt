******************
Program Controller
******************
The Program Controller controls invocation of the initialization
routines, the other major compiler modules, and the finish routine.

Initialization is performed by the routine
*init*
at the
very beginning of execution.


==================
Program Controller
==================
See figure 2-1 for a pseudo-code description of the Program Controller processing.

.. code-block:: none

   init();

   for (each subprogram) {
       reinit();   /\* init for subprogram \*/
       parser();   /\* Scan, parse and semantically analyze \*/

       if (no severe errors) {
           transform();
           convert_output();
           output();
       }
   }

   finish();


Figure 2-1 Program Controller Operation

Note that each subprogram is completely processed and output before the
next subprogram is processed. Conceptually, it is as if each subprogram
were in a separate file.

Also, note that invocation of the Scanner and Semantic Analyzer are
controlled by the Parser in a traditional bottom-up
syntax directed translation.


====
Init
====
The
``init``
module performs the following five major tasks:

#. Processes command line and sets values of internal variables
   depending on the flags specified by the user.

#. Opens input and output files.

#. If a listing file is being generated, writes the Listing
   Header.

#. Initializes the Error message module, Symbol table module,
   Scanner, and Semantic Analyzer by calling the appropriate
   init routine for each.

#. If the user requested that the source file be run through the
   C preprocessor, invoke the internal preprocessor (\c
   ``fpp``)
   and write its output to a temporary file, which becomes the input
   file to the parser.


-------------------------
Adding Command Line Flags
-------------------------
The command line processor searches the structure
``swtchtab[]``
(defined in
*main.c*
)
to
find valid flags or flag prefixes.
To add a flag, add the new flag (without
the preceeding
"\(mi")
to
``swtchtab[]``'s
initialization, keeping the flags in lexicographic order.
Also add a case constant to the initialization.
Switch case constants are
``#define``'d
constants of the form
``SW_<flag name in caps>``,
and appear
above the definition
of
``swtchtab``.
The case constant must be unique but numerical order is not necessary.
(i.e., you don't have to change existing constants, just use the next
biggest unused integer.)

Add the case label
``SW_<flag name in caps>:``
to
``init()``
(also defined in
*main.c*
).
Also, add code to process flag and any values that follow the flag.
See existing code in
``init()``
for examples.


======
Finish
======
``finish``
is called at the end of compiler execution to
close files, write a compilation summary line to the
user's terminal, and exit.
