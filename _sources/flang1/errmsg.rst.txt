Error message severities:


     I - informative.
     W - warning.
     S - severe error.
     F - fatal error.
     V - variable.








**V000** *Internal compiler error. $ $*
   This  message indicates an error in the compiler, rather than
   a user error - although it may be possible for a user error to
   cause an internal error.  The severity may vary; if it is informative or
   warning, correct object code was probably generated - but it is not
   real safe to rely on this.
   Regardless of the severity or cause, internal errors should be reported
   to the compiler maintenance group.

**F001** *Source input file name not specified*
   On the command line, source file name should be specified either before all
   the switches, or after them.

**F002** *Unable to open source input file: $*
   Source file name misspelled, file not in current working directory,
   or file is read protected.

**F003** *Unable to open listing file*
   Probably, user does not have write permission for the current working
   directory.

**F004** *$ $*
   Generic message for file errors.

**F005** *Unable to open temporary file - $*
   The compiler uses directory "/usr/tmp" or "/tmp" in which to create
   temporary files.  If neither of these directories is available on
   the node on which the compiler is being used, this error will occur.

**S006** *Input file empty*
   Source input file does not contain any Fortran statements other
   than comments or compiler directives.

**F007** *Subprogram too large to compile at this optimization level $*
   Internal compiler data structure overflow, working storage
   exhausted, or some other non-recoverable
   problem related to the size of the subprogram.
   If this error occurs at opt 2, reducing the opt level to 1 may
   work around the problem.
   Moving the subprogram being compiled to its own source file may
   eliminate the problem.
   If this error occurs while compiling a subprogram of fewer than
   2000 statements it should be reported to the compiler maintenance
   group as a possible compiler problem.

**F008** *Error limit exceeded*
   The compiler gives up because too many severe errors were issued;
   the error limit can be reset on the command line.

**F009** *Unable to open assembly file*
   Probably, user does not have write permission for the current working
   directory.

**F010** *File write error occurred $*
   Probably the file system is full.

**S011** *Unrecognized command line switch: $*
   Refer to PDS reference document for list of allowed compiler switches.

**S012** *Value required for command line switch: $*
   Certain switches require an immediately following value,
   such as "-opt 2".

**S013** *Unrecognized value specified for command line switch: $*

**S014** *Ambiguous command line switch: $*
   Too short an abbreviation was used for one of the switches.

**W015** *Hexadecimal or octal constant truncated to fit data type*

**I016** *Identifier, $, truncated to $ chars*
   If -Mstandard is used, an identifier may be at most 63 characters in length;
   characters after the 63rd are ignored. Otherwise, the maximum number of
   characters is specified in gbldefs.h (see #define MAXIDLEN)

**S017** *Unable to open include file: $*
   File is missing, read protected, or maximum include depth (10) exceeded.
   Remember that the file name should be enclosed in quotes.

**S018** *Illegal label $ $*
   Used for label 'field' errors or illegal values.
   E.g., in fixed source form,
   the label field (first five characters) of the indicated line contains
   a non-numeric character.

**S019** *Illegally placed continuation line*
   A continuation line does not follow an initial line, or more than
   99 continuation lines were specified.

**S020** *Unrecognized compiler directive*
   Refer to PGI reference manual for list of allowed compiler directives.

**S021** *Label field of continuation line is not blank*
   The first five characters of a continuation line must be blank.

**S022** *Unexpected end of file - missing END statement*

**W023** *Syntax error - unbalanced $*
   Unbalanced parentheses or brackets.

**W024** *CHARACTER or Hollerith constant truncated to fit data type*
   A character or hollerith constant was converted to a data type that was not
   large enough to contain all of the characters in the constant.  This type
   conversion occurs when the constant is used in an arithmetic expression or is
   assigned to a non-character variable.  The character or hollerith constant is
   truncated on the right, that is, if 4 characters are needed then the first 4
   are used and the remaining characters are discarded.

**W025** *Illegal character ($) - ignored*
   The current line contains a character, possibly non-printing,
   which is not a legal Fortran character (characters inside of character
   or Hollerith constants cannot cause this error).
   As a general rule, all non-printing characters are treated as white space
   characters (blanks and tabs); no error message is generated when this occurs.
   If for some reason, a non-printing character is not treated as a white
   space character,
   its hex representation is printed in the form dd where each d is a hex digit.

**S026** *Unmatched quote*

**S027** *Illegal integer constant: $*
   Integer constant is too large for 32 bit word.

**S028** *Illegal real or double precision constant: $*

**S029** *Illegal $ constant: $*
   Illegal hexadecimal, octal, or binary constant.
   A hexadecimal constant consists of digits 0..9 and letters A..F or a..f;
   any other character in a hexadecimal constant is illegal.
   An octal constant consists of digits 0..7; any other digit or
   character in an octal constant is illegal.
   A binary constant consists of digits 0 or 1; any other digit or
   character in a binary constant is illegal.

**S030** *Explicit shape must be specified for $*

**S031** *Illegal data type length specifier for $*
   The data type length specifier (e.g. 4 in INTEGER\*4) is not a
   constant expression that is a member of the set of allowed
   values for this particular data type.

**W032** *Data type length specifier not allowed for $*
   The data type length specifier (e.g. 4 in INTEGER\*4) is not allowed
   in the given syntax (e.g. DIMENSION A(10)\*4).

**S033** *Illegal use of constant $*
   A constant was used in an illegal context, such as on the left side of
   an assignment statement or as the target of a data initialization
   statement.

**S034** *Syntax error at or near $*

**I035** *Predefined intrinsic $ loses intrinsic property*
   An intrinsic name was used in a manner inconsistent with the language
   definition for that intrinsic.  The compiler, based on the context, will
   treat the name as a variable or an external function.

**S036** *Illegal implicit character range*
   First character must alphabetically precede second.

**S037** *Contradictory data type specified for $*
   The indicated identifier appears in more than one type specification
   statement and different data types are specified for it.

**S038** *Symbol, $, has not been explicitly declared*
   The indicated identifier must be declared in a type statement;
   this is required when the IMPLICIT NONE statement occurs in the
   subprogram.

**W039** *Symbol, $, appears illegally in a SAVE statement $*
   An identifier appearing in a SAVE statement must be a local
   variable or array.

**S040** *Illegal common variable $*
   Indicated identifier is a dummy variable, is already in
   a common block, or has previously been defined to be
   something other than a variable or array.

**W041** *Illegal use of dummy argument $*
   This error can occur in several situations.  It can occur if dummy
   arguments were specified on a PROGRAM statement.  It can also occur
   if a dummy argument name occurs in a DATA, COMMON, SAVE, or EQUIVALENCE
   statement.
   A program statement must have an empty argument list.

**S042** *$ is a duplicate dummy argument*

**S043** *Illegal attempt to redefine $ $*
   An attempt was made to define a symbol in a manner inconsistent with
   an earlier definition of the same symbol.  This can happen for a number
   of reasons.  The message attempts to indicate the situation that occurred.
   * \*(tfintrinsic\*(rf - 
   An attempt was made to redefine an intrinsic function.
   A symbol that represents an intrinsic function may be redefined if that
   symbol has not been previously verified to be an intrinsic function.  For
   example, the intrinsic \*(tfsin\*(rf can be defined to be an integer array.
   If a symbol is verified to be an intrinsic function via the
   \*(cfINTRINSIC\*(rf statement or via an intrinsic function reference then
   it must be referred to as an intrinsic function for the remainder of the
   program unit.
   * \*(tfsymbol\*(rf - 
   An attempt was made to redefine a symbol that was
   previously defined.  An example of this is to declare a symbol to be
   a \*(rfPARAMETER\*(rf which was previously declared to be a subprogram
   argument.

**S044** *Multiple declaration for symbol $*
   A redundant declaration of a symbol has occurred.
   For example, an attempt was made to declare a symbol
   as an \*(cfENTRY\*(rf when that symbol
   was previously declared as an \*(cfENTRY\*(rf.

**S045** *Data type of entry point $ disagrees with function $*
   The current function has entry points with data types inconsistent with the
   data type of the current function.  For example, the function returns type
   character and an entry point returns type complex.

**S046** *Data type length specifier in wrong position*
   The CHARACTER data type specifier has a different position for the length
   specifier from the other data types.  Suppose, we want to declare arrays
   ARRAYA and ARRAYB to have 8 elements each having an element length of
   4 bytes.  The difference is that ARRAYA is character and ARRAYB is integer.
   The declarations would be CHARACTER ARRAYA(8)\*4 and INTEGER ARRAYB\*4(8).

**S047** *More than seven dimensions specified for array*

**S048** *Illegal use of '*' in declaration of array $*
   An asterisk may be used only as the upper bound of the last dimension.

**S049** *Illegal use of '*' in non-subroutine subprogram*
   The alternate return specifier '\*' is legal only in the subroutine
   statement.  Programs, functions, and block data are not allowed to
   have alternate return specifiers.

**S050** *Assumed size array, $, is not a dummy argument*

**S051** *Unrecognized built-in % function*
   The allowable built-in functions are %VAL, %REF, %LOC, and %FILL.  One
   was encountered that did not match one of these allowed forms.

**S052** *Illegal argument to %VAL or %LOC*

**S053** *%REF or %VAL not legal in this context*
   The built-in functions %REF and %VAL can only be used as actual
   parameters in procedure calls.

**W054** *Implicit character $ used in a previous implicit statement*
   An implicit character has been given an implied data type more than once.
   The implied data type for the implicit character is changed anyway.

**W055** *Multiple implicit none statements*
   The IMPLICIT NONE statement can occur only once in a subprogram.

**W056** *Implicit type declaration*
   The -dclchk switch and an implicit declaration following an IMPLICIT
   NONE statement will produce a warning message for IMPLICIT statements.

**S057** *Illegal equivalence of dummy variable, $*
   Dummy arguments may not appear in EQUIVALENCE statements.

**S058** *Equivalenced variables $ and $ not in same common block*
   A common block variable must not be equivalenced with a variable
   in another common block.

**S059** *Conflicting equivalence between $ and $*
   The indicated equivalence implies a storage layout inconsistent
   with other equivalences.

**S060** *Illegal equivalence of structure variable, $*
   STRUCTURE and UNION variables may not appear in EQUIVALENCE statements.

**S061** *Equivalence of $ and $ extends common block backwards*

**W062** *Equivalence forces $ to be unaligned*
   EQUIVALENCE statements have defined an address for the variable
   which has an alignment not optimal for variables of its data type.
   This can occur when INTEGER and CHARACTER data are equivalenced,
   for instance.

**I063** *Gap in common block $ before $*

**S064** *Illegal use of $ in DATA statement implied DO loop*
   The indicated variable is referenced where it is
   not an active implied DO index variable.

**S065** *Repeat factor less than zero*

**S066** *Too few data constants in initialization statement*

**S067** *Too many data constants in initialization statement*

**S068** *Numeric initializer for CHARACTER $ out of range 0 through 255*
   A CHARACTER\*1 variable or character array element
   can be initialized to an integer, octal, or hexadecimal constant if that
   constant is in the range 0 through 255.

**S069** *Illegal implied DO expression*
   The only operations allowed within an implied DO expression are
   integer +, -, \*, and /.

**S070** *Incorrect sequence of statements $*
   The statement order is incorrect.  For instance, an IMPLICIT NONE statement
   must precede a specification statement which in turn must precede an
   executable statement.

**S071** *Executable statements not allowed in block data*

**S072** *Assignment operation illegal to $ $*
   The destination of an assignment operation must be a variable, array
   reference, or vector reference.  The assignment operation may be by
   way of an assignment statement, a data statement, or the index variable
   of an implied DO-loop.  The compiler has determined that the identifier
   used as the destination, is not a storage location.  The error message
   attempts to indicate the type of entity used.
   * \*(tfentry point\*(rf - 
   An assignment to an entry point that was not
   a function procedure was attempted.
   * \*(tfexternal procedure\*(rf - 
   An assignment to an external procedure
   or a Fortran intrinsic name was attempted.
   if the identifier is the name of an entry point
   that is not a function, an external procedure...

**S073** *Intrinsic or predeclared, $, cannot be passed as an argument*

**S074** *Illegal number or type of arguments to $ $*
   The indicated symbol is an intrinsic or generic function, or
   a predeclared subroutine or function,
   requiring a certain number of arguments of a fixed data type.

**S075** *Subscript, substring, or argument illegal in this context for $*
   This can happen if you try to doubly index an array such as ra(2)(3).
   This also applies to substring and function references.

**S076** *Subscripts specified for non-array variable $*

**S077** *Subscripts omitted from array $*

**S078** *Wrong number of subscripts specified for $*

**S079** *Keyword form of argument illegal in this context for $$*

**S080** *Subscript for array $ is out of bounds*

**S081** *Illegal selector $ $*

**S082** *Illegal substring expression for variable $*
   Substring expressions must be of type integer and if constant
   must be greater than zero.

**S083** *Vector expression used where scalar expression required*
   A vector expression was used in an illegal context.  For example,
   iscalar = iarray, where a scalar is assigned the value of an array.
   Also, character and record references are not vectorizable.

**S084** *Illegal use of symbol $ $*
   This message is used for many different errors.

**S085** *Incorrect number of arguments to statement function $*

**S086** *Dummy argument to statement function must be a variable*

**S087** *Non-constant expression where constant expression required*

**S088** *Recursive subroutine or function call of $*
   A function may not call itself.

**S089** *Illegal use of symbol, $, with character length = **
   Symbols of type CHARACTER\*(\*) must be dummy variables and must
   not be used as statement function dummy parameters and statement
   function names.  Also, a dummy variable of type CHARACTER\*(\*) cannot
   be used as a function.

**S090** *Hollerith constant more than 4 characters*
   In certain contexts, Hollerith constants may not be more
   than 4 characters long.

**S091** *Constant expression of wrong data type*

**S092** *Illegal use of variable length character expression*
   A character expression used as an actual argument, or in certain
   contexts within I/O statements, must not consist of a concatenation
   involving a passed length character variable.

**W093** *Type conversion of expression performed*
   An expression of some data type appears in a context which requires
   an expression of some other data type.
   The compiler generates code to convert the expression into the required type.

**S094** *Variable $ is of wrong data type $*
   The indicated variable is used in a context which requires a variable
   of some other data type.

**S095** *Expression has wrong data type*
   An expression of some data type appears in a context which requires
   an expression of some other data type.

**S096** *Illegal complex comparison*
   The relations .LT., .GT., .GE., and .LE. are not
   allowed for complex values.

**S097** *Statement label $ has been defined more than once*
   More than one statement with the indicated
   statement number occurs in the subprogram.

**S098** *Divide by zero*

**S099** *Illegal use of $*
   Aggregate record references may only appear in aggregate assignment
   statements, unformatted I/O statements, and as parameters to subprograms.
   They may not appear, for example, in expressions.  Also, records with
   differing structure types may not be assigned to one another.

**S100** *Expression cannot be promoted to a vector*
   An expression was used that required a scalar quantity to be promoted
   to a vector illegally.  For example, the assignment of a character constant
   string to a character array.  Records, too, cannot be promoted to vectors.

**S101** *Vector operation not allowed on $*
   Record and character typed entities may only be referenced as scalar quantities.

**S102** *Arithmetic IF expression has wrong data type*
   The parenthetical expression of an arithmetic if statement must be an
   integer, real, or doubleprecision scalar expression.

**S103** *Type conversion of subscript expression for $*
   The data type of a subscript expression must be integer.  If it is not, it is
   converted.

**S104** *Illegal control structure $*
   This message is issued for a number of errors involving
   IF-THEN statements and DO loops.
   If the line number specified is the last line (END statement) of
   the subprogram, the error is probably an unterminated DO loop or
   IF-THEN statement.

**S105** *Unmatched ELSEIF, ELSE or ENDIF statement*
   An ELSEIF, ELSE, or ENDIF statement cannot be matched with a
   preceding IF-THEN statement.

**S106** *DO index variable must be a scalar variable*
   The DO index variable cannot be an array name, a subscripted variable,
   a PARAMETER name, a function name, a structure name, etc.

**S107** *Illegal assigned goto variable $*

**S108** *Illegal variable, $, in NAMELIST group $*
   A NAMELIST group can only consist of arrays and scalars.

**I109** *Overflow in $ constant $, constant truncated at left*
   A non-decimal (hexadecimal, octal, or binary) constant requiring more than
   64-bits produces an overflow.  The constant is truncated at
   left (e.g. '1234567890abcdef1'x will be '234567890abcdef1'x).

**I110** **

**I111** *Underflow of real or double precision constant*

**I112** *Overflow of real or double precision constant*

**S113** *Label $ is referenced but never defined*

**S114** *Cannot initialize $*

**W115** *Assignment to DO variable $ in loop*

**S116** *Illegal use of pointer-based variable $ $*

**S117** *Statement not allowed within a $ definition*
   The statement may not appear in a STRUCTURE or derived type definition.

**S118** *Statement not allowed in BLOCK, DO, IF, WHERE, or other executable construct*

**I119** *Redundant specification for $*
   Data type of indicated symbol specified more than once.

**I120** *Label $ is defined but never referenced*

**I121** *Operation requires logical or integer data types*
   An operation in an expression was attempted on data having a data type
   incompatible with the operation.  For example, a logical expression can
   consist of only logical elements of type integer or logical.  Real data
   would be invalid.

**I122** *Character string truncated*
   Character string or Hollerith constant appearing in a DATA statement
   or PARAMETER statement has been truncated to fit the declared size of
   the corresponding identifier.

**W123** *Hollerith length specification too big, reduced*
   The length specifier field of a hollerith constant specified more characters
   than were present in the character field of the hollerith constant.  The
   length specifier was reduced to agree with the number of characters
   present.

**S124** *Relational expression mixes character with numeric data*
   A relational expression is used to compare two arithmetic expressions or
   two character expressions.  A character expression cannot be compared to an
   arithmetic expression.

**I125** *Dummy procedure $ not declared EXTERNAL*
   A dummy argument which is not declared in an EXTERNAL statement is used
   as the subprogram name in a CALL statement, or is called as a function,
   and is therefore assumed to be a dummy procedure.
   This message can result from a failure to declare a dummy array.

**I126** *Name $ is not an intrinsic function*

**I127** *Optimization level for $ changed to opt 1 $*

**W128** *Integer constant truncated to fit data type: $*
   An integer constant will be truncated when assigned to data types smaller
   than 32-bits, such as a BYTE.

**I129** *Floating point overflow. Check constants and constant expressions*

**I130** *Floating point underflow. Check constants and constant expressions*

**I131** *Integer overflow. Check floating point expressions cast to integer*

**I132** *Floating pt. invalid oprnd. Check constants and constant expressions*

**I133** *Divide by 0.0. Check constants and constant expressions*

**S134** *Illegal attribute $ $*

**W135** *Missing STRUCTURE name field*
   A STRUCTURE name field is required on the outermost structure.

**W136** *Field-namelist not allowed*
   The field-namelist field of the STRUCTURE statement is disallowed on the
   outermost structure.

**W137** *Field-namelist is required in nested structures*

**W138** *Multiply defined STRUCTURE member name $*
   A member name was used more than once within a structure.

**W139** *Structure $ in RECORD statement not defined*
   A RECORD statement contains a reference to a STRUCTURE that has not yet been
   defined.

**S140** *Variable $ is not a RECORD*

**S141** *$ required on left of $*

**S142** *$ is not a component of this OBJECT*

**S143** *$ requires initializer*

**W144** *NEED ERROR MESSAGE $ $*
   This is used as a temporary message for compiler development.

**W145** *%FILL only valid within STRUCTURE block*
   The %FILL special name was used outside of a STRUCTURE multiline statement.
   It is only valid when used within a STRUCTURE multiline statement even
   though it is ignored.

**S146** *Expression must be character type*
   

**S147** *Character expression not allowed in this context*
   

**S148** *Reference to $ required*
   An aggregate reference to a record was expected during statement compilation
   but another data type was found instead.

**S149** *Record where arithmetic value required*
   An aggregate record reference was encountered when an arithmetic
   expression was expected.

**S150** *Structure, Record, derived type, or member $ not allowed in this context*
   A structure, record, or member reference was found in a context which is
   not supported.

**S151** *Empty TYPE, STRUCTURE, UNION, or MAP*
   TYPE - ENDTYPE, STRUCTURE - ENDSTRUCTURE, UNION - ENDUNION MAP - ENDMAP
   declaration contains no members.

**S152** *All dimension specifiers must be ':'*

**S153** *Array objects are not conformable $*

**S154** *DISTRIBUTE target, $, must be a processor*

**S155** *$ $*

**S156** *Number of colons and triplets must be equal in ALIGN $ with $*

**S157** *Illegal subscript use of ALIGN dummy $ - $*

**S158** *Alternate return not specified in SUBROUTINE or ENTRY*
   An alternate return can only be used if alternate return
   specifiers appeared in the SUBROUTINE or ENTRY statements.

**S159** *Alternate return illegal in FUNCTION subprogram*
   An alternate return cannot be used in a FUNCTION.

**S160** *ENDSTRUCTURE, ENDUNION, or ENDMAP does not match top*

**S161** *Vector subscript must be rank-one array*

**W162** *Not equal test of loop control variable $ replaced with < or > test.*

**S163** **

**S164** *Overlapping data initializations of $*
   An attempt was made to data initialize a variable or
   array element already initialized.

**S165** *$ appeared more than once as a subprogram*
   A subprogram name appeared more than once in the source file.
   The message is applicable only when an assembly file is the
   output of the compiler.

**S166** *$ cannot be a common block and a subprogram*
   A name appeared as a common block name and a subprogram name.
   The message is applicable only when an assembly file is the
   output of the compiler.

**I167** *Inconsistent size of common block $*
   A common block occurs in more than one subprogram of a source file
   and its size is not identical. The maximum size is chosen.
   The message is applicable only when an assembly file is the
   output of the compiler.

**S168** *Incompatible size of common block $*
   A common block occurs in more than one subprogram of a source file
   and is initialized in one subprogram.
   Its initialized size was found to be less than
   its size in the other subprogram(s).
   The message is applicable only when an assembly file is the
   output of the compiler.

**W169** *Multiple data initializations of common block $*
   A common block is initialized in more than one subprogram of a source file.
   Only the first set of initializations apply.
   The message is applicable only when an assembly file is the
   output of the compiler.

   which does not expect a value.
   In either case, the qualifier for which the error occurred is indicated
   in the error message.

**S198** *$ $ in ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE*

   An internal error occurred during interprocedural analysis;
   please report this to the compiler maintenance group.
   If user errors were reported when collecting IPA information
   or during IPA analysis, correcting them may avoid this error.

**I367** *Array $ bounds cannot be matched to formal argument*
   Passing a nonsequential array to a sequential dummy argument may require
   copying the array to sequential storage.
   The most common cause is passing an ALLOCATABLE array or array expression
   to a dummy argument that is declared with explicit bounds.
   Declaring the dummy argument as assumed shape, with bounds (:,:,:), will
   remove this warning.

   distribution format
   to a dummy argument with prescriptive or descriptive distribution format.

**I374** *Cannot propagate distribution target from $ to $*
   The most common cause is when passing an array with a transcriptive
   distribution target
   to a dummy argument with prescriptive or descriptive distribution target.

**I375** *Distribution format mismatch between $ and $*
   Usually this arises when the actual and dummy arguments are distributed
   in different dimensions.

   in its alignment to its template than does the dummy argument.

**I378** *Distribution target mismatch between $ and $*
   This may arise when the actual and dummy arguments have different
   distribution target sizes.

**I379** *Alignment of $ is too complex*

   The given common block was not optimized by interprocedural analysis
   either because it was not declared
   in the main program, or because it was declared differently in
   different subprograms.

**E400** *IPA: dummy argument $ is an asterisk, but actual argument is not a label*
   The subprogram expects an alternate return label for this argument.

**E401** *Actual argument $ is a subprogram, but Dummy argument $ is not declared EXTERNAL*
   The call statement passes a function or subroutine name to a dummy
   argument that is a scalar variable or array.

**E402** *Actual argument $ is illegal*

**E403** *Actual argument $ and formal argument $ have different ranks*
   The actual and formal array arguments differ in rank, which is allowed only
   if both arrays are declared with the HPF SEQUENCE attribute.

**E404** *Sequential array section of $ in argument $ is not contiguous*
   When passing an array section to a formal argument that has the
   HPF SEQUENCE attribute, the actual argument must be a whole array with
   the HPF SEQUENCE attribute, or an array section of such an array
   where the section is a contiguous sequence of elements.

**E405** *Array expression argument $ may not be passed to sequential dummy argument $*
   When the dummy argument has the HPF SEQUENCE attribute, the actual argument
   must be a whole array with the HPF SEQUENCE attribute or a contiguous
   array section of such an array, unless an INTERFACE block is used.

**E406** *Actual argument $ and formal argument $ have different character lengths*
   The actual and formal array character arguments have different character
   lengths, which is allowed only
   if both character arrays are declared with the HPF SEQUENCE attribute,
   unless an INTERFACE block is used.

**W407** *Argument $ has a different character length than dummy argument $*
   The character length of the actual argument is different than the length
   specified for the corresponding dummy argument.

**W408** *Specified main program $ is not a PROGRAM*

**I413** *Formal argument $ has two reaching distributions and may be a candidate for cloning*

**I414** *$ and $ may be aliased and one of them is assigned*
   Interprocedural analysis has determined that two formal arguments
   because the same variable is passed in both argument positions,
   or one formal argument and a global or COMMON variable may be aliased,
   because the global or COMMON variable is passed as an actual argument.
   If either alias is assigned in the subroutine, unexpected results may occur;
   this message alerts the user that
   this situation is disallowed by the Fortran standard.

**F415** *IPA fails: incorrect IPA file*
   Interprocedural analysis saves its information in special IPA files in the
   specified IPA directory.  One of these files has been renamed or corrupted.
   This can arise when there are two files with the same prefix,
   such as 'a.hpf' and 'a.f90'.

**E416** *Argument $ has the SEQUENCE attribute, but the dummy parameter $ does not*
   When an actual argument is an array with the SEQUENCE attribute, the

   A subroutine or function call may not pass an element of an array, like 'A(N)', to a dummy array argument if the array 'A' is not sequential.
   If the array is sequential, then Fortran sequence and storage association rules will treat the dummy argument as a new array equivalenced to the actual argument starting at the element passed.
   If the array is not sequential, then Fortran sequence and storage association rules do not apply.

**W473** *$ must have the PURE attribute*
   A PURE subprogram can only call other PURE subprograms.

**E475** *A dummy argument may not be distributed in a PURE interface - $*

   Expressions are not allowed.

**E479** *The dummy argument $ is REFLECTED; the actual argument $ must have a visible device copy*
   If a dummy argument has the Accelerator REFLECTED attribute, the actual argument must be a symbol
   with a visible device copy.
   This may be because the symbol appeared in a MIRROR, REFLECTED, COPYIN, COPYOUT, COPY or LOCAL declarative Accelerator directive,
   or because it appeared in a COPYIN, COPYOUT, COPY or LOCAL clause for an Accelerator
   DATA REGION or REGION surrounding the procedure call.

**E480** *Argument $ is passed to dummy argument $, which is REFLECTED; the actual argument must not require runtime reshaping*
   When an actual argument is an array section or pointer array section, sometimes the
   actual argument must be copied to a temporary array.  This may occur if the
   dummy argument is not assumed-shape, and so must be contiguous in memory, or if
   the actual argument is not stride-1 in the leftmost (first) dimension.  In these
   cases, the REFLECTED argument is not supported.

**E486** *The dummy argument $ is REFLECTED; an array element cannot be passed to a REFLECTED argument*
   An actual argument that is an array element cannot be passed to a REFLECTED dummy argument.

**E487** *Index variable $ does not appear in a subscript on the left hand side of the FORALL assignment*
   In a FORALL statement, each index variable in the FORALL must appear in some subscript of the left hand side of the FORALL assignment.
   Otherwise, the FORALL will assign the same left hand side elements for different values of that index.

**S488** *$ is not PURE - $*
   DO CONCURRENT and FORALL subprogram calls must be PURE or ELEMENTAL.

**I489** *An ALLOCATE of a POINTER with transcriptive or inherited distribution causes replication - $*
   When an array with the POINTER attribute and with a distributed that is transcriptive or inherited is allocated,
   the alignment and distribution are ignored and the array pointer is treated as replicated,
   since there is no symbol from which to inherit a distribution.

**E490** *An array section of $ is passed to the REFLECTED argument $, which is not supported*
   When an actual argument is an array section, the dummy argument must not have
   the REFLECTED argument.

   that is not used; the REDISTRIBUTE or REALIGN is eliminated.

**E498** *Alignment cycle involving two or more arguments - $*
   This dummy argument appears in an HPF ALIGN directive specifying alignment to another
   dummy argument that is then aligned to this argument, or aligned to another dummy
   argument that is eventually aligned to this argument.

**W499** *The descriptive distribution or alignment for this dummy argument is treated as prescriptive - $*
   Even though the distribution or alignment for this dummy argument was specified as
   descriptive, it is treated as prescriptive.

**E500** *MODULE $ uses (directly or indirectly) MODULE $, which causes a USE cycle*
   If MODULE A has a USE statement for MODULE B, we say that MODULE A directly uses MODULE B.
   If MODULE B has a USE statement for MODULE C, we say that MODULE A indirectly uses MODULE C.
   If MODULE C then has a USE statement for MODULE A, then MODULE A indirectly uses itself,
   which is a USE cycle, and is not allowed.

**E504** *DIM argument out of range for this symbol - $*
   The DIM argument to this transformation intrinsic (CSHIFT, EOSHIFT, ...) must
   be between 1 and the rank of the array or expression being transformed.

**E505** *DIM argument out of range for this reduction - $*

   CUDA Fortran DEVICE or GLOBAL subprograms cannot access data from any MODULE except
   the MODULE containing the subprogram, unless they are being compiled for compute
   capability 2.0 or higher.  This feature requires the unified memory system provided
   in compute capability 2.0.

**E522** *MODULE data cannot be used in a DEVICE or GLOBAL subprogram unless compiling with CUDA Toolkit 3.0 or later - $*
   CUDA Fortran DEVICE or GLOBAL subprograms cannot access data from any MODULE except

   which requires allocation of temporary storage to produce a correct result.
   Dynamic allocation of memory is not supported in subprograms that run on
   the device.

**E525** *Array reshaping is not supported for device subprogram calls: argument $ to subprogram $*
   Passing an array section or assumed-shape array to a non-assumed-shape dummy argument is not supported

**W526** *SHARED attribute ignored on dummy argument $*
   The SHARED attribute has no meaning when applied to a dummy argument.

**E527** *Argument number $ requires allocation of a temporary which is not supported in DEVICE or GLOBAL subprograms*

**W603** *Unsupported clause specified for the vector directive. Only the always clause is supported.*

**W604** *Unsupported clause specified for the omp simd directive. The directive will be ignored.*

**F701** *Error reading temp file - $*
   This may occur if the file system failed, or the file system or directory containing
   the temporary file filled up.
   The compiler typically uses the "/tmp" directory to create temporary files.
   You may specify a directory to use for temporary files with the TMPDIR environment variable.

**F702** *Error writing temp file - $*
   This may occur if the file system containing the temporary file is full.

   This message may occur if you compile one or more files with -Mipa, and then link those
   files with a different version of the compiler.
   The solution is to disable -Mipa at the link step, or recompile those files with the
   same version of the compiler used to link.

**W802** *Stale or wrong version of .ipa file: $*
   The IPA information generated by the link step does not match the
   file being compiled.  This is usually caused when copying object files
   or libraries so the modification dates of the object files are invalid.
   The solution is to clear the object files and rebuild from source files.
