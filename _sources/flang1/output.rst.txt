Overview
========
The AST transformer performs the following tasks:

*  lower the AST representation to the compiler's ILM intermediate representation.

*  write out the ILMs and symbol information into a temporary (.ilm) file that
   is read by f90 (the LLVM bridge).

*  If we are generating code for a module, then write ILMs and symbols to a
   module (.mod) file.
