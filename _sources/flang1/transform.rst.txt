Transformer
***********


========
Overview
========

The transformer module performs a number of manipulations on the AST
and on the Symbol Table.  The object of these manipulations is to
place the internal data structures in a canonical form that is easy
to process by later phases.

The following transformations are performed on the AST:

*  Canonicalize alignment and distribution directives and create symbols
   for descriptors.

*  Transform array assignments and WHERE statements into FORALL statements.

*  Canonicalize FORALL statements

*  Rewrite arguments of subroutines, array-valued intrinsics and functions,
   and various intrinsics.

*  Perform transformations on sequential variables and common blocks.

The Symbol Table and AST are modified by this module. Statements are
inserted and deleted, and new symbols created.

Data Structures
===============


----------------------
Global Data Structures
----------------------

*Symbol Table* --- New symbols are created for the following data items:

*  Alignment descriptors and their pointers.

Each aligned array is assigned
an alignment descriptor, which is a one-dimensional integer array, with
a bound of 1. The
alignment descriptor is created as a based variable, and a pointer for
the alignment descriptor is created.  The various variables are accessed
as follows: given a symbol pointer
``sptr``
for an aligned array A, the alignment descriptor (array) for A is accessed
via
``DESCRG(sptr)``,
and the pointer to the alignment descriptor (as for any based variable)
is accessed via
``MIDNUMG(DESCRG(sptr))``.

*  Section descriptors and their pointers.

A section descriptor is created for each aligned array; the descriptor will
describe the entire array. The descriptor is pointed to by
``DESCRG(sptr)``.

*  Processor descriptors and their pointers.

Each
``ST_PROCESSOR``
symbol has a descriptor, created in the same way as alignment descriptors,
and referenced via
``DESCRG``.

*  Template descriptors and their pointers.
   ``ST_TEMPLATE``
   symbols receive descriptors in the same way as
   ``ST_PROCESSOR``
   symbols.

*  Internal
   ``ST_PROCESSOR``
   and
   ``ST_TEMPLATE``
   symbols.

For arrays directly distributed onto processor arrangements,
templates are created. For distributed arrays and templates with no
explicit processor arrangement, processor arrangements are created.
These use internal compiler-created names but are otherwise the same
as user-defined templates and processors.

*AST* --- 
The AST is modified by insertion and deletion of statements. The modification
is described in more detail in the section on processing.

Local Data Structures
---------------------

There are no significant local data structures in the transform module.


==========
Processing
==========


--------
Overview
--------

The main processing function is
``transform()``.
It performs canonical alignment transformations, rewrites foralls containing
transformational intrinsics, rewrites block WHERE statements,
rewrites subroutine and intrinsic calls, converts array assignments
and WHERE statements into foralls, and
foralls into canonical form.  Also, descriptor symbols are created.

The processing for the transform module is performed
in two files:
``transfrm.c``and
``func.c``.


---------------------------
Transformational Intrinsics
---------------------------

``rewrite_forall_intrinsic``
removes transformational intrinsics from forall statements.
For example,

.. code-block:: none

   forall (i=1:n, j=1:n)
       a(i,j) = a(i,j) + sum(b(i,:)\*c(:,j))

is transformed into:

.. code-block:: none

   do i = 1,n
      do j = 1,n
         temp(i,j) = sum(b(i,:) \* c(:,j)
      enddo
   enddo
   forall (i=1:n, j=1:n)
      a(i,j) = a(i,j) + temp(i,j)



------------
Block Wheres
------------
``rewrite_block_where``
converts block WHERE constructs into single-statement
WHEREs.  For example,

.. code-block:: none

   WHERE (a .gt. 0)
       a = 12
       b = a / 13
   ENDWHERE

is transformed into:

.. code-block:: none

   temp = a .gt. 0
   WHERE (temp) a = 12
   WHERE (temp) b = a / 13

Note that the temporary is always created; this could be avoided in many
cases some analysis; for example, if no variable referenced in the mask
expression is assigned to in the block, then no temporary is required.


--------------------
Subroutine Arguments
--------------------
``rewrite_calls()``
is the most complex part of the transform module. The file
``func.c``
contains this function. It is responsible for
three tasks:

#. Rewrite array expression arguments to functions to use temporaries. For
   example,

   .. code-block:: none

      call sub(a(1:n:2) + b(1:m:3))

   becomes

   .. code-block:: none

      allocate temp(1:n:2)
      temp = a(1:n:2) + b(1:m:3)


#. Rewrite expressions using array-valued functions, and the calls to those
   functions. This involves creating a temporary to hold the return value
   of the function. This is done currently only for intrinsic functions.

#. Rewrite intrinsics. This is the most important part of
   ``rewrite_calls.``

Intrinsic rewriting is performed on transformational intrinsics, as well
as a number of Fortran intrinsics. Transformational intrinsics are
turned into calls to runtime support functions.
Here is an example:

Consider the statement:

.. code-block:: none

   a = SUM(b \* c, dim=2, mask=a .ne. 0) + d

First, a temporary is created to hold the expression
``b\*c``.
This is done as part of the array expression argument processing. A temporary
is also created for the mask expression. Then, the function
``rewrite_func_ast``
is called. It determines that the appropriate runtime call is
``ftn_sum``.
A call to this function is generated. Since the result of the intrinsic
is used in an expression, a temporary to hold the return value is also
generated.

The generated code looks like:

.. code-block:: none

   allocate temp1
   temp1 = b\*c
   allocate temp2
   temp2 = a .ne. 0
   allocate temp3
   call ftn_sum(temp3, temp1, dim, temp2)
   a = temp3
   deallocate temp3
   deallocate temp2
   deallocate temp1



--------------------
Rewrite Into Foralls
--------------------
The function
``rewrite_into_forall()``
converts array assignments and WHERE statements into forall statements.
This is relatively straightforward; special care must be taken for
array-valued subscripts. Also, an attempt is made to generate the forall
so that later DO-loops will be in column major order.


---------------
Rewrite Foralls
---------------
``rewrite_forall``
creates temporaries for forall statements that would have a dependence
if directly scalarized (this functionality will be moved to a later
phase). It also handles vector foralls, such as:

.. code-block:: none

   forall (i=1:n) a(i,:) = b(i,:)

These are converted into foralls with multiple indices:

.. code-block:: none

   forall (i=1:n,j=1:m) a(i,j) = b(i,j)

This should probably be part of an earlier phase.
