******************
Program Controller
******************
The Program Controller (main routine) controls invocation of the initialization
routines, the other major compiler modules, and the finish routine.

Initialization is performed by the routine
*init*
at the
very beginning of execution.


==================
Program Controller
==================
Each subprogram is completely processed and output before the
next subprogram is processed. Conceptually, it is as if each subprogram
were in a separate file.
For Fortran 90 contained subprograms, some information must be preserved
from the host subprogram to the contained subprograms, particularly any
stack or BSS addresses assigned to host subprogram variables.

The same source file is used to generate the program controller
for both the compiler and the extractor, since they share so much code.
The differences in the source code appear as tests of the preprocessor
variable
``EXTRACTOR,``
which is defined only for the extractor controller.

See figure 2-1 for a pseudo-code description of the Program Controller processing
for the compiler.
See figure 2-2 for a pseudo-code description of the Program Controller
for the extractor.

.. code-block:: none

   init();

   for (each subprogram) {
      reinit();   /\* init for subprogram \*/
      upper();    /\* import ILMs from F90 front end \*/
      extractor();/\* optionally extract subprograms for future inlining \*/
      expand();   /\* expand ILMs into shared ILI \*/
      upper_save_syminfo();       /\* save host subprogram info \*/
      xref();     /\* optionally generate cross reference \*/
   }

   finish();

   }

====
Init
====
The
``init``
module performs the following five major tasks:

#. Processes command line and sets values of internal variables
   depending on the flags specified by the user.

#. Opens input and output files.

#. If a listing file is being generated, writes the Listing
   Header.

#. Initializes the Error message module, Symbol table module,
   Scanner, Directive processing, and other modules
   by calling the appropriate init routine for each.


---------------------
Adding Compiler Flags
---------------------
The command line processor searches the structure
``swtchtab[]``
(defined in
``main.c``)
to
find valid flags or flag prefixes.
To add a flag, add the new flag (without
the preceeding
"\(mi")
to
``swtchtab[]``'s
initialization, keeping the flags in lexicographic order.
Also add a case constant to the initialization.
Switch case constants are
``#define``'d
constants of the form
``SW_<flag name in caps>``,
and appear
above the definition
of
``swtchtab``.
The case constant must be unique but numerical order is not necessary.
(i.e., you don't have to change existing constants, just use the next
biggest unused integer.)

Add the case label
``SW_<flag name in caps>:``
to
``init()``
(also defined in
``main.c``).
Also, add code to process flag and any values that follow the flag.
See existing code in
``init()``
for examples.


======
Finish
======
``finish``
is called at the end of compiler execution to
close files, write a compilation summary line to the
user's terminal, and exit.


=========
Debugging
=========
The development compiler supports debug output in the
compile process; these are mostly
disabled when the preprocessor variable DEBUG is zero,
as is done for a release.
Most debug output is enabled with a
``-q``
or
``-qq``
switch.
Each of these takes two arguments;
the
``-q 45 8``
sets bit mask
``8``
in
``flg.dbg[45]``.
This is tested in the compiler source code with

.. code-block:: none

       #if DEBUG
          if( DBGBIT(45,8) ) fprintf( gbl.dbgfil, "debug output\\n" );
       #endif

The
``#if DEBUG``
test disables this code for a release.
The
``DBGBIT(45,8)``
macro is shorthand for
``(flg.dbg[45]&8)``.

Debug output is normally written to
``gbl.dbgfil``,
which is normally be opened to the file
``filename.qdbg``
by
*init*
unless
``-q 0 1``
is specified, which says to open
``gbl.dbgfil``
to standard output.
Using the compiler driver, debug switches can be set using

.. code-block:: none

       -Mq,45,8
       -Mq,66,7

where the latter sets bits 1, 2, and 4.

The controller can also generate dumps during
compile process.
At various points in the controller will appear a line like:

.. code-block:: none

       DUMP( "expand" );

This is a preprocessor macro that calls a generic debug dump routine.
To enable a dump, you can pass a
``-qq``
switch to the compiler like

.. code-block:: none

       -qq expand blocks

which will invoke the
``blocks``
dump after the
``expand``
phase.
Multiple phases and multiple dumps can be specified at once, like

.. code-block:: none

       -qq expand+optimize blocks
       -qq unroll printblocks+sym

which will invoke the
``blocks``
dump after both the
``expand``
and
``optimize``
phases, and will invoke both the
``printblocks``
and
``sym``
dumps after the
``unroll``
phase.
Using the driver, these would appear as

.. code-block:: none

       -Mqq,expand+optimize,blocks
       -Mqq,unroll,printblocks+sym

Specifying
``all``
as the phase name will invoke those dump routines after all phases.
The list of available phases is available by looking at the source code
for the

.. code-block:: none

       DUMP( "phase" )

lines, or by looking at the
``filename.qdbg``
file for lines something like

.. code-block:: none

       {pgf90-linux86-64 after expand
       {pgf90-linux86-64 after upper

The dump controller prints out these lines before every active phase, and will
generate any dumps after each of these lines.
New dump points can be inserted anywhere in the source of the program controller.
The list of available dumps is only available by looking at the source code
of the program controller; look for the variable
``dumpnames``.
New dump names can be added here, and the appropriate dump code added
in the switch statement in routine
``do_debug``.
