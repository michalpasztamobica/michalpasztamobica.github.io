=====
Scope
=====
This document is the design specification for the Fortran
compiler, **Flang**.
The following subjects are included:

#. First level module decomposition of the compiler and flow of
   control between the modules.

#. Processing and data structure overview for each
   first level module.

#. Detailed specification of those data structures which are used
   by more than one first level module.
   This includes definition of the various internal code
   representations used within **Flang**.

#. Detailed (external) specification of compiler routines required by more than
   one module, for example, symbol table access and error reporting
   routines.

#. Descriptions of important algorithms used by **Flang**.

#. Full descriptions of utility programs used to build tables, etc.
   used by **Flang**.

#. Certain coding conventions and practices, including the source file directory
   structure and file naming conventions.

Topics not covered include:

#. **Flang** function specifications or requirements.

#. Design of compiler run-time support or I/O libraries.

#. Detailed specification of data structures or routines
   local to a single module, except for those critical
   for the module design.


======
Design
======
**Flang** is divided into a number of passes which
communicate via various internal forms of
the user's program.
Figure 1-1 gives an overview of the compiler control flow
and some of the important data items.
Refer to the Document Overview section below for more detail.

===========
Conventions
===========
A number of the usual notational conventions are used
informally throughout this document.
These include use of
"["]
for optional items and
"|\^"
to indicate
a choice of items.

A basic knowledge of the C programming language is assumed
throughout this document.  In particular:

#. pseudo-code descriptions of algorithms use a C-like syntax
   and control structures.

#. function routine definitions are given using C syntax.

#. reference is made to the various C data types.
   Note particularly the use of the special data type INT, defined in the
   utility package specification [8], which is used for integer data
   which requires 32 bits.

=================
Document Overview
=================
A variety of compiler modules, data structures, files, and utility
programs are described in this document.
This section summarizes the contents of this document and
tells where to find information on the various subjects.


---------------
Compiler Inputs
---------------

*Command Line* --- The command line specifies the input and output files and the
switches to be in effect for a given compilation.
Its format and the allowed switches are described in the **Flang**
functional specification [1].
Processing of the command line is performed by the initialization
module INIT, described in section 2.

*Source Input File* --- The input to **Flang** is a file written in the version of the C language
described in [1].
This file is read and tokenized by the Scanner module, described
in section 4.


----------------
Compiler Outputs
----------------

*Object Module File* --- The object file format is described in the Object File Standard, [4].
This file is written by the Assembler module described in
section 9.

*Source Listing* --- The listing of the user's source file is written by the Scanner
(section 4) as it reads the source input file.

*Object Code Listing* --- The Object Code Listing is an assembler type listing of
the object code generated by **Flang**.
It is written by the Assembler, described in section 9.

*Cross Reference Listing* --- an alphabetical listing of user defined symbols and labels
giving the various attributes (e.g. data type) of the
symbols and the source line numbers of references to each
symbol.
It is written by the Cross Reference Generator, described in section 10.


--------
Compiler
--------

*Program Controller and Initialization* --- initializes the compiler and controls invocation of the
remaining compiler modules.

*Scanner* --- reads the source input file and breaks it up into tokens
which are passed to the Parser.
The C preprocessor functions, such as macro expansion, conditional
compilation, and include file processing, are performed
by the Scanner.
It writes the source listing, if requested, and enters
symbols into the Symbol Table.  See section 3.

*Parser* --- performs syntactic analysis of the user's program
using tokens returned by the Scanner.
Calls the appropriate semantic analysis routines
as it parses.
Issues syntax errors when detected and makes limited attempts
to recover from them.
See section 4.

*Semantic Analyzer* --- performs semantic error checking, translates the user program
into the first internal representation, ILMs, and enters
information into the Symbol Table.  See section 5.

*Expander* --- translates the ILMs produced by the Semantic Analyzer into
the second internal representation, ILI.

*Cross Reference Generator* --- writes the Cross Reference Listing using information in the
Symbol Table and the Reference File.
See section 10.


--------------------
Subprogram Libraries
--------------------

*SCUTIL* --- is the utility package used for I/O, numerical conversions,
operating system interfacing, etc.
This library is described in reference [5].

*Error Reporting Routines* --- is a set of routines used to construct and issue compiler error
diagnostics, described in section 17.

*Symbol Table Access Routines* --- is a set of routines used throughout the compiler to enter
symbols into the symbol table.
These are described with the Symbol Table, section 11.


----------------------------------
Dynamic Data Bases/Temporary Files
----------------------------------

*Symbol Table* --- contains information on user defined and compiler created
symbols and constants, used throughout the compiler.
See section 11.

*Intermediate Language Macros (ILMs)* --- is the internal representation of the executable statements of the
user's program, created by the Semantic Analyzer and
translated into ILI by the Expander.
These are written to a temporary binary file as they are created.
Section 12 describes the format, etc., of the ILMs and
Appendix IV contains the definition of the ILM opcodes,
their meanings, and attributes.

*Intermediate Language Instructions (ILI)* --- is the internal representation of the user's program, created by the
Expander.
The general format of the ILI, and associated data structures
are described in section 13.
Appendix V contains the definitions of the ILI opcodes,
their attributes, and their mappings into micro operations.

*Data Initialization File* --- is an external binary file containing data initialization
information written during semantic analysis of declarations
which contain initializations.
This is used by the Assembler to create
part of the Object Module File.  The format of this file
is described in section 16.

*Reference File* --- is a temporary external binary file written by the Semantic Analyzer,
containing symbol/line number usage information used
by the Cross Reference Generator to create the Cross Reference Listing.
Format is described in section 10.


--------------------------------------
Static Data Bases and Utility Programs
--------------------------------------
Several phases of **Flang** are table driven.
These tables have fixed values and are typically initialized
by C source code created by utility programs using text
files as input.
In most cases the input file is also used to create one of the
appendices to this document, ensuring the accuracy of the
appendices.
The important static data bases and the utilities which
generate them are:

*Parse Tables (PRSTAB)* --- are LR(1) parse tables created by the utility PRSTAB and used by
the Parser.
The format of these tables is described in reference [7].
Appendix I contains a listing and symbol cross reference of the
grammar used to create the parse tables.

*Error Messages (ERRMSG)* --- is the structure containing the text of error messages, created by
the utility ERRMSG, and used by the Error Reporting routines
to issue error messages.
Appendix II lists the messages issued by **Flang**.

*ILM Attributes and Templates (ILMTP)* --- are tables created by the utility ILMTP
which define the attributes of the various ILM opcodes and
their translation into ILI.
See section 12 for the format of this information, and
Appendix IV for the current attribute and template values.

*ILI Attributes and Templates (ILITP)* --- are tables created by the utility ILITP which
define the attributes of the various ILI and their
translation into micro-operations.
See section 13 for the format of this information and
Appendix V for the current attribute and template values.

*Micro Operations (MICROP)* --- are the primitive operations making up an ILI template and which
are combined to form SC instructions.
The tables defining the micro operations are created by the utility
MICROP and used by the Assembler.
The format of this information, and the MICROP utility, are
described in section 14.
Appendix VI contains a listing of the current symbolic
definition of
the micro operations.
